h2. rinterface: Ruby to Erlang client

rinterface is a pure Ruby client that can send RPC calls to an Erlang node. It's very much a work in progress.

h3. Requirements

 * Erlang 12B-5
 * Ruby
 * Ruby gems
 * Eventmachine

h3. Try it out

 1. Open a terminal, Cd into the test directory and run:
   'make'
   'make run'
   
This will start the erlang node named 'math'

 2. Open another terminal, and run: 'ruby sample.rb'

h3. How to use?

In your Ruby code, make a call to the Erlang node like this:
<pre>
<code>
 # Erlang::Node(nodename,module,function,args) => [:ok,Response] | [:badprc,Reason]

 r = Erlang::Node.rpc("math","math_server","add",[10,20])

 if r[0] == :badrpc
   puts "Got and Error. Reason #{r[1]}"
 else
   puts "Success: #{r[1]}"
 end
</code>
</pre>

Where:

 * math is the node name (the -sname of the Erlang node)
 * math_server is the name of the module
 * add is the funtion to call
 * [10,20] is an array of arguments to pass to the function

The result will always be an Array of the form:
<pre>
<code>
 [:ok,Response] where Response is the result from the Erlang
 
  or

 [:badrpc,Reason] where Reason is the 'why' it failed
</code>
</pre>

h3. So you wanna call Erlang from your Rails app...

Here's a quick and simple example. Make sure you put the rinterface lib into RAILS_ROOT/lib and start the math_server in 'test'

In the controller:

controllers/math_controller.rb
<pre>
<code>
require 'lib/rinterface'

class MathController < ApplicationController
  def index
    a = params[:a]
    b = params[:b]
    r = Erlang::Node.rpc("math","math_server","add",[a.to_i,b.to_i])
    
    if r[0] == :badrpc
      @result = "Error"
    else
      @result = r[1]
    end
    
  end
end
</code>
</pre>

Finally, add a template for the view, and try 'http://localhost:3000/math?a=2&b=3'.

This is not ideal yet and not something I'd use yet in production, but it's a starting point for experimenting.
